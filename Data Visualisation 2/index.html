          The Olympics, otherwise known as the Olympic Games, are international sporting events that include both 
          Summer and Winter sports. The first Olympic Games was held on 6 April 1896 in Athens, and the most recent
          Olympic Games was the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics held on 23 July 2021 in Tokyo. <br><br>
          Thousands of athletes from over 200 nations participate in the Olympics, which is typically held every 4
          years, alternating between Summer and Winter Olympics every 2 years. Before the 1992 Olympic Games, they
          were held every 4 years, with no distinction between Summer and Winter sports. <br><br>
          Due to World War 1, there were no Olympic Games held between 1912 - 1920, and due to World War 2, there 
          were no Olympic Games held between 1936 - 1948.

          This visualisation will identify how the Weight, Height, and Age are distributed across different events
          and sports, as well as visualise how these trends have developed over Olympic history. The number of
          medals that a typical athlete from each Country wins in the Olympics can also be identified, along with
          the total number of medals of each type won by each country. Lastly, the relationship between winning
          each type of medal in each sport, against Weight, Height, and Age of athletes will be shown.
